Objects classification on fMRI data

**Abstract** 

Neuroimaging is a relatively new field emerged with the development in neuroscience, psychology and computer science 
which works with brain images to capture and analyze the structures and functions in parts of nervous system.
Thanks for the development of MRI techniques, compute and storage capability of modern computers as well as 
the efficiency machine learning algorithms, nowadays we can capture human brain images in high resolution 
and use this data to analyze the structure of human brain. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms, 
now we are able to investigate how brain functions in certain activities. 

In this project, we apply artificial neural network in observed objects classification 
using fMRI data set. In addition, since the neuroimaging data is considered big data, we also analyze 
the performance in terms of used resources such as CPU and memory to have an idea of where is the bottleneck, 
what could be improved to optimize resource usage.
